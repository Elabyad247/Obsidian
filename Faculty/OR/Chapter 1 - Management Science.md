### System
	a collection of people, resources, concepts, and procedures to serve a goal

### Decision making
   **Decision:** a course of action consciously chosen from available alternatives for the purpose of desired goal

   **Planning:** series of decisions

  - **Decision making process steps**
	  1. Define the problem
	  2. Search for alternatives
	  3. Evaluate the alternatives
	  4. Select on alternative

### Operation Research (Management Science)
	An analytical method of problem-solving and decision-making that is useful in the management of organizations. Problems are broken down into basic components and then solved in defined steps by mathematical analysis.
	In the industrial world, the most important problem for which these techniques are used is how to optimize the profit or how to reduce the costs.

  - **OR Characteristics**
	  - A primary focus on managerial decision making
	  - The application of the scientific approaches to decision making
	  - The use of methods and knowledge of several disciplines
	  - A reliance on mathematical and quantitative models
	  - The extensive use of computers

- **OR Models**
	- An model is defined as simplified representation of a system.
	  `An approximation or abstraction of real world including its essential elements, which is constructed by establishing relationships among various variables of system, is called a model.`

	- Break-Even Model
		- `Used to determine the number of units to sell or produce that will equate total revenue with total cost`
		`Profit at break-even point is zero`
		- Components
			- Fixed Cost ($c_{f}$)
			- Variable Cost ($c_{v}$)
			- Volume ($v$)
			- Total Variable Cost ($v*c_{v}$)
			- Total Cost ($TC$)
				$TC = c_{f} + v*c_{v}$
			- Unit Price ($p$)
			- Profit ($Z$)
				$Z = (v*p) - TC$
		- Computing the Break-Even Point
			$Z = 0$
			$v*p - TC = 0$
			$v*p - c_{f} - v*c_{v} = 0$
			$v(p-c_{v}) = c_{f}$
			${v = {{{c_{f}} \over {p - c_{v}}}}}$

- **OR Process**
	- Observation: identify problem in a system
	- Definition of the problem: must be clearly and consistently defined
	- Model Construction: develop the functional mathematical relationships
	- Model Solution: solve model using OR techniques
	- Model Implementation: use the model or it's solution<br><br>
	1. Problem Definition
	2. Classification
	3. Formulation, Validation
	4. Model Solution
	5. Sensitivity Analysis
	6. Implementation
