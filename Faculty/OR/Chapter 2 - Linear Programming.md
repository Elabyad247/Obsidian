### Linear Programming
	Maximizing profit or minimizing costs using linear algebraic relationships given a business objective and resource constraints

  - LP Steps
	  - Identify problem as solvable by LP
	  - Formulate a mathematical model
	  - Solve the model
	  - Implementation
	  <br>
  - LP Model Components
	  - Decision variables: mathematical symbols representing levels of activity of a firm
	  - Objective function: a linear mathematical relationship describing an objective of the firm in the terms of decision variables that is maximized or minimized
	  - Constraints: restrictions placed on the firm stated in linear relationships of decision variables
	  - Parameters: numerical coefficients and constants used in the objective function and constraints
  <br>
  - LPM Steps
	  - Define the decision variables
	  - Construct the objective function
	  - Formulate the constraints
  <br>
  - Example

  - LPM Solution
	- **Feasible solution:** does not violate any of the constraints
		   - Unique optimal solution
		   - Alternative optimal solution (infinity)
		   - Unbounded solution
	- **Infeasible solution:** violates at least one of the constraints

    - Graphical solution
		 - Provides visualization of how a solution for LPM is obtained
			 `Graphical solution is limited to LPM containing only 2 decision variables`
		   <br>
		  - **Feasible Solution Area (FSA):** The constraints and non- negativity conditions define the Feasible Solution Area.
	 		 `Each point inside the FSA and on the borders of this area considers a feasible solution of the problem.`
		  <br>
	    - Steps
			1. Determine the Feasible Solution Area.
			2. Determine the corner (extreme) points of FSA. The optimal solution is one of the corner points.
